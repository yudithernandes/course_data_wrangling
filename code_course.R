# Paths and the Working Directory

getwd()


# Download the dslabs packages. This is the example dataset, we are working with

library(dslabs)
library(tidyverse)

# Where is the dataset from dslabs stored in my system? Which files are stored?

system.file("extdata", package = "dslabs")
path <- system.file("extdata", package = "dslabs")
list.files(path)

### Importing the files to my working directory

# 1. getting the right path name

filename <- "murders.csv"
fullpath <- file.path(path, filename)
fullpath

# 2 . copying the filename in my working directory

file.copy(fullpath, getwd())

# 3. checking if the file is in my working directory

file.exists(filename)

# Before importing the dataset in R, we want to know wich format it has, in order to choose the right code to import it

read_lines ("murders.csv", n_max = 3)    # read only the first 3 lines, to see if there is a header

# Importing the dataset in R with tidyverse

dat <- read_csv(filename)  # importing data with read_csv from tidyverse

head(dat)

# Importing the dataset in R with R-base functions

dat2 <- read.csv(filename)

head(dat2)

# What is the difference when importing with R-Base comparing to importing with tidyverse?

class(dat)  # when importing with the tidyverse we get a table (tibble)
class(dat2) # when importing with R-base we get a data frame

# Question 1: ok, and? table vs data.frame? 
# see https://megapteraphile.wordpress.com/2020/03/25/data-frame-vs-data-table-vs-tibble-in-r/
# 1. data.frame are the original data structure in R-Base
# 2. data.table is faster than data.frame (use less memory)
# 3. tibble has the class tbl_df and is a perfection of the original data.frame. It belongs to the tidyverse, so it works
# with the tidyverse packages: ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr and readr

###### Start: Downloading the file from Github with url

url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rafalab/dslabs/master/inst/extdata/murders.csv"
dat <- read_csv(url)
download.file(url, "murders.csv")
tempfile()  
tmp_filename <- tempfile()

# tempfile creates a character string that is likely to be a unique filename. 
# tempdir() creates a directory with a name that is very unlikely not to be unique.

# or downloading the file to my pc

download.file(url, tmp_filename)
dat <- read_csv(tmp_filename)
file.remove(tmp_filename)

###### End: Downloading the file from Github

# the separator "_" is the default separater, so we can omit this argument



# separate on underscores (the default), convert years to numeric
dat %>% separate(name, c("year", "name"), convert = TRUE)

# because the "life_expectancy" variable has also an underscore "_", it will be drop out. This is a new issue. To solve it, we added a third column for expectancy.
# But there is again a new issue: for fertility, the third column has only NA values


# split on all underscores, pad empty cells with NA
dat %>% separate(name, c("year", "name_1", "name_2"), 
                 fill = "right", convert = TRUE)

# Another way to solve this, is to separate the first underscore, but keep the second merged.

# split on first underscore but keep life_expectancy merged
dat %>% separate(name, c("year", "name"), sep = "_", 
                 extra = "merge", convert = TRUE)

# Now we create two variables from the variable "name" using the pivot_wider ()

# separate then create a new column for each variable using pivot_wider
dat %>% separate(name, c("year", "name"), sep = "_", 
                 extra = "merge", convert = TRUE) %>%

# Assessment Part 1: Reshaping Data (ok well done)

# Assessment Part 2: Reshaping Data

# Question 11: Examine the built-in dataset co2. This dataset comes with base R, not dslabs - just type co2 to access the dataset.

co2  # no tidy: Month variable is the header

# Question 12: Run the following code to define the co2_wide object:

co2_wide <- data.frame(matrix(co2, ncol = 12, byrow = TRUE)) %>% 
  setNames(1:12) %>%
  mutate(year = as.character(1959:1997))

head(co2_wide)  # the previous command did not change the data very much, only change the name of the months. The dataset were saved as a data.frame (39 obs of 13 variables)

co2_tidy <- co2_wide %>%
  pivot_longer(-year, names_to = "month", values_to = "co2")

head(co2_tidy)

# Question 13: Use co2_tidy to plot CO2 versus month with a different curve for each year:

co2_tidy %>% 
  ggplot(aes(as.numeric(month), co2, color = year)) + 
  geom_line()

# Question 14: Load the admissions dataset from dslabs, which contains college admission information for men and women across six majors, and remove the applicants percentage column:

library(dslabs)
data(admissions)
dat <- admissions %>% 
  select(-applicants)

head(dat)

dat_tidy <- pivot_wider(dat, names_from = gender, values_from = admitted)

head(dat_tidy)

# Question 15: Now use the admissions dataset to create the object tmp, which has columns major, gender, key and value:

tmp <- admissions %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(admitted, applicants), names_to = "key", values_to = "value")
tmp

# Combine the key and gender and create a new column called column_name to get a variable with the following values: 
# admitted_men, admitted_women, applicants_men, and applicants_women. Save the new data as tmp2.

tmp2 <- tmp %>%
  unite(column_name, key, gender)

tmp2

# Question 16: Which function can reshape tmp2 to a table with six rows and five columns named major, 
# admitted_men, admitted_women, applicants_men, and applicants_women?
