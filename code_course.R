# Where is the dataset from dslabs stored in my system? Which files are stored?

system.file("extdata", package = "dslabs")
path <- system.file("extdata", package = "dslabs")
list.files(path)

### Importing the files to my working directory

# 1. getting the right path name

filename <- "murders.csv"
fullpath <- file.path(path, filename)
fullpath

# 2 . copying the filename in my working directory

file.copy(fullpath, getwd())

# 3. checking if the file is in my working directory

file.exists(filename)

# Before importing the dataset in R, we want to know wich format it has, in order to choose the right code to import it

read_lines ("murders.csv", n_max = 3)    # read only the first 3 lines, to see if there is a header

# Importing the dataset in R with tidyverse

dat <- read_csv(filename)  # importing data with read_csv from tidyverse

head(dat)

# Importing the dataset in R with R-base functions

dat2 <- read.csv(filename)

head(dat2)

# What is the difference when importing with R-Base comparing to importing with tidyverse?

class(dat)  # when importing with the tidyverse we get a table (tibble)
class(dat2) # when importing with R-base we get a data frame

# Question 1: ok, and? table vs data.frame? 
# see https://megapteraphile.wordpress.com/2020/03/25/data-frame-vs-data-table-vs-tibble-in-r/
# 1. data.frame are the original data structure in R-Base
# 2. data.table is faster than data.frame (use less memory)
# 3. tibble has the class tbl_df and is a perfection of the original data.frame. It belongs to the tidyverse, so it works
# with the tidyverse packages: ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr and readr

  setNames(1:12) %>%
  mutate(year = as.character(1959:1997))

tmp

# Combine the key and gender and create a new column called column_name to get a variable with the following values:

### Groups with regex: permits the extraction of values, they are define between parentheses () - like encapsulate
# Groups do not affect the pattern matching per se, instead, it permits tools to identify specific parts of the pattern 
# so we can extract them

# Example, we want to change heights written like 5.6 to 5'6, but avoid changing patterns such as 70.5 into 70'5.
# So, we can not replace . for '

# define regex with and without groups
pattern_without_groups <- "^[4-7],\\d*$"
pattern_with_groups <-  "^([4-7]),(\\d*)$"

# create examples
yes <- c("5,9", "5,11", "6,", "6,1")
no <- c("5'9", ",", "2,8", "6.1.1")
s <- c(yes, no)

# demonstrate the effect of groups - there is no effect on the matching process
str_detect(s, pattern_without_groups)
str_view_all(s, pattern_without_groups)

str_detect(s, pattern_with_groups)
str_view_all(s, pattern_with_groups)

# Results are identical, the use of groups does not affect the matching process. 
# The use of groups only signals that we want to save what is captured/encapsulate by the groups
# So, when defining groups we can use the function str_match() instead str_detect

# demonstrate difference between str_match and str_extract
str_match(s, pattern_with_groups)
str_extract(s, pattern_with_groups)

str_match(s, pattern_without_groups) # if we have a pattern without groups, the function str_match() is unable to split
# the match into the values of each entries.

# str_match split the entries into the position of each value. We can see there is NA if there is not match with the pattern
# as expected the groups does not affect the process of matching.

# Another advantage of using groups, is that for the process of searching and replacing we can 
# specify which position of the group we want to replace - with the regex \\i which refers
# to the i- th group´s  element - ex. \\2 is the value extracted for the second group

# improve the pattern to recognize more events (using groups and i-th groups and replacing)
pattern_with_groups <-  "^([4-7]),(\\d*)$"
yes <- c("5,9", "5,11", "6,", "6,1")
no <- c("5'9", ",", "2,8", "6.1.1")

# str_replace - search in s the pattern and replaced the first matched value with ' and the second matched value with "
str_replace(s, pattern_with_groups, "\\1'\\2")

# expected is: 5,9 replaced by 5'9"
#              5,11 replaced by 5'11"
#              6,   replaced by 6'
#              6,1  replaced by 6'1"

# final pattern: we want to replace x.y - x,y - x y by x'y
# so, we adapt the pattern_with_groups to capture and replace all these cases

pattern_with_groups <-"^([4-7])\\s*[,\\.\\s+]\\s*(\\d*)$"

# \\s*[,\\.\\s+]\\s* all this is allow between the two groups: none or more whitespaces, 
# [the feet symbol is either comma, point, or at least one whitespaces] and none or more whitespaces


# combine stringr commands with the pipe
str_subset(problems, pattern_with_groups) %>% 
  head %>%
  cat()
# here are the first 6 matches with the adapted pattern, now we can replace them by x'y

str_subset(problems, pattern_with_groups) %>%

### Video: Separate with regex
# We want not only identify and match a pattern, but also extract and save the entries of the character vector

# first example - normally formatted heights with the format x'y
s <- c("5'10", "6'1")
tab <- data.frame(x = s)
tab

# the separate and extract functions behave similarly, but with extract() from tidyr package we can use regex as argument
# and gives us the flexibility of using groups.

tab %>% 
  separate(x, c("feet", "inches"), sep = "'")

tab %>% 
  extract(x, c("feet", "inches"), regex = "(\\d)'(\\d{1,2})")  # using extract with groups from regex

# second example - some heights with unusual formats
s <- c("5'10", "6'1\"","5'8inches")
tab <- data.frame(x = s)
tab

# separate fails because it leaves in extra characters, but extract keeps only the digits because of regex groups

  extract(x, c("feet", "inches"), regex = "(\\d)'(\\d{1,2})")  #very nice extract()

# Remaining problems, which were not solved with the previous patterns

# 1- Many students measuring exactly 5 or 6 feet did not enter any inches. For example, 6' - our pattern requires that inches be included.
# 2- Some students measuring exactly 5 or 6 feet entered just that number.
# 3- Some of the inches were entered with decimal points. For example 5'7.5''. Our pattern only looks for two digits.
# 4- Some entries have spaces at the end, for example 5 ' 9.
# 5- Some entries are in meters and some of these use European decimals: 1.6, 1,7.
# 6- Two students added cm.
# 7- One student spelled out the numbers: Five foot eight inches.

# Solutions:

# 1- add '0 to convert all 6 to 6'0, then our pattern will match

yes <- c("5", "6", "5")
no <- c("5'", "5''", "5'4")
s <- c(yes, no)
str_replace(s, "^([4-7])$", "\\1'0")

# The pattern says it has to start (^), be followed with a digit between 4 and 7, and then end there ($). 
# The parenthesis defines the group that we pass as \\1 to the replace regex.

# 2 and 4 (not really understood)
# ? none or one '

str_replace(s, "^([56])'?$", "\\1'0")

# 3 - we want allow for inches decimal point and not only two digits - so can 5'7.5 the 7.5 part fits
# patter must be modified by allowing nor or one .

pattern <- "^[4-7]\\s*'\\s*(\\d+\\.?\\d*)$"

# 5 - Meters using commas, we can approach similarly to how we converted the x.y to x'y. 
# A difference is that we require that the first digit is 1 or 2:

yes <- c("1,7", "1, 8", "2, " )
no <- c("5,8", "5,3,2", "1.7")
s <- c(yes, no)
s
str_replace(s, "^([12])\\s*,\\s*(\\d*)$", "\\1\\.\\2")

# We will later check if the entries are meters using their numeric values.

# Trimming
# Spaces at the beginng or end of a string is a general enough problem that there 
# is a function dedicated to removing them: str_trim.

str_trim("5 ' 9 ")
str_trim("   5   '   9   ") # eliminate spaces at the ^ or $ of a string, but not in the middle

# 7 - letters instead numbers
# To upper and to lower case

s <- c("Five feet eight inches")
str_to_lower(s)

# others:
str_to_upper(s)
str_to_title(s)

# Putting it into a function
# We are now ready to define a procedure that handles converting all the problematic cases.

convert_format <- function(s){
  s %>%
    str_replace("feet|foot|ft", "'") %>% #convert feet symbols to '

    str_replace("^([56])'?$", "\\1'0") %>% #add 0 when to 5 or 6
    str_replace("^([12])\\s*,\\s*(\\d*)$", "\\1\\.\\2") %>% #change european decimal
    str_trim() #remove extra space
}


# We can also write a function that converts words to numbers:

words_to_numbers <- function(s){
  str_to_lower(s) %>%  
    str_replace_all("zero", "0") %>%
    str_replace_all("one", "1") %>%
    str_replace_all("two", "2") %>%
    str_replace_all("three", "3") %>%
    str_replace_all("four", "4") %>%

raw_data_research_funding_rates <- txt[2]

# Examining this object
raw_data_research_funding_rates %>%
  head()

# we see that it is a long string. Each line on the page, including the table rows, is separated by the symbol for newline: \n.
# \n is the separator. This separator we need for the function str_split()

# We can therefore create a list with the lines of the text as elements:

tab <- str_split(raw_data_research_funding_rates, "\n")
tab

# Because we start off with just one element in the string, we end up with a list with just one entry:

tab <- tab[[1]]

tab %>% head()

# we see that the information for the column names is the third and fourth entires:

the_names_1 <- tab[3]

the_names_2 <- tab[5]


# In the table, the column information is spread across two lines. We want to create one vector with one name for each column. 
# We can do this using some of the functions we have just learned.

# Extracting the table data
# Let's start with the first line:

the_names_1

# We want to remove the leading space and everything following the comma. We can use regex for the latter. 
# Then we can obtain the elements by splitting using the space. We want to split only when there are 2 or more spaces 
# to avoid splitting success rate. So we use the regex \\s{2,} as follows:

the_names_1 <- the_names_1 %>%
  str_trim() %>%
  str_replace_all(",\\s.", "") %>%   # # this removes the , n and %. So  \\s. removes everything after the comma
  str_split("\\s{2,}", simplify = TRUE) # it removes if more than two whitespaces and simplify = TRUE get the index position
the_names_1

# Now let's look at the second line:

the_names_2

# Here we want to trim the leading space and then split by space as we did for the first line:

the_names_2 <- the_names_2 %>%
  str_trim() %>%
  str_split("\\s+", simplify = TRUE)
the_names_2

# Now we can join these to generate one name for each column:

tmp_names <- str_c(rep(the_names_1, each = 3), the_names_2[-1], sep = "_")  # each = 3 because there are 3 columns "Total" "Men" "Women and the_names_2[-1] because we do not need to match the column "Discipline" to the_names_1
the_names <- c(the_names_2[1], tmp_names) %>%  
  str_to_lower() %>%
  str_replace_all("\\s", "_")
the_names

# Now we are ready to get the actual data. By examining the tab object, we notice that the information is in lines 6 through 14. 
# We can use str_split() again to achieve our goal:

new_research_funding_rates <- tab[7:14] %>%
  str_trim %>%
  str_split("\\s{2,}", simplify = TRUE) %>%
  data.frame(stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>%
  setNames(the_names) %>%
  mutate_at(-1, parse_number)


new_research_funding_rates %>%
  head()

# We can see that the objects are identical:
  
identical(research_funding_rates, new_research_funding_rates)

# The end date of the poll will always be one or two digits, followed by a space, followed by the month as one or more letters (either capital or lowercase). 
# In these data, all month abbreviations or names have 3, 4 or 5 letters.
# Write a regular expression to extract the end day and month from dates. Insert it into the skeleton code below:

temp <- str_extract_all(polls$dates, "\\d{1,2}\\s[a-zA-Z]+")

end_date



#  temp <- str_extract_all(polls$dates, _____)
# end_date <- sapply(temp, function(x) x[length(x)]) # take last element (handles polls that cross month boundaries)


# Which of the following regular expressions correctly extracts the end day and month when inserted into the blank in the code above?
# Check all correct answers.

# Assessment Part 1: Dates, Times, and Text Mining

# Use the following libraries and options for coding questions:

library(dslabs)
library(lubridate)
options(digits = 3)    # 3 significant digits

# Question 3

# Loading the data frame brexit_polls

data(brexit_polls)

names(brexit_polls) # to see the variables´ names

# How many polls had a start date (startdate) in April (month number 4)?

month <- month(brexit_polls$startdate, label = FALSE )
table(month)  # 25

# Option of 1965eric
sum(month(brexit_polls$startdate) == 4)

# Use the round_date() function on the enddate column with the argument unit="week". How many polls ended the week of 2016-06-12?  

table(round_date(brexit_polls$enddate, unit = "week"))  # 13

# Option of 1965eric
sum(round_date(brexit_polls$enddate, unit = "week") == "2016-06-12")

# Question 4

# Use the weekdays() function from lubridate to determine the weekday on which each poll ended (enddate).
# On which weekday did the greatest number of polls end?
? weekdays

table(weekdays(brexit_polls$enddate, abbreviate = FALSE)) # stackoverflow: to avoid the german names of the week: Sys.setlocale("LC_TIME", "en_US")
# Answer: Sunday

# Option 1965eric probably something like which.max
max(weekdays(brexit_polls$enddate)) # this does not work. The right code is what I did
min(weekdays(brexit_polls$enddate)) # max and min gives the first and last name of the day of the week according to the sorted names

# Question 5

# Load the movielens data frame from dslabs.

data(movielens)

glimpse(movielens) # to see the variables´class

# This data frame contains a set of about 100,000 movie reviews. The timestamp column contains the review date as the number 
# of seconds since 1970-01-01 (epoch time).

# Convert the timestamp column to dates using the lubridate as_datetime() function.

movielens <- movielens %>%
  mutate(timestamp_1 = as_datetime(timestamp))

# Assessment Part 2: Dates, Times, and Text Mining "Project Gutenberg"
# In this part of the assessment, you will walk through a basic text mining and sentiment analysis task.

# Use these libraries and options:
  
install.packages("gutenbergr")
library(gutenbergr)
library(dplyr)
data(gutenberg_metadata)

# Question 6
# Use str_detect() to find the ID of the novel Pride and Prejudice.

gutenberg_metadata %>%
  filter(str_detect(title, "Pride and Prejudice"))

# the answer is 6 and not 7, because the id 37431 is double

# Question 7

# Notice that there are several versions of the book. The gutenberg_works() function filters this table to remove replicates 
# and include only English language works. Use this function to find the ID for Pride and Prejudice.

# What is the correct ID number?
gutenberg_works(title == "Pride and Prejudice", languages = "en")

# Question 8

# Use the gutenberg_download() function to download the text for Pride and Prejudice. 
# Use the tidytext package to create a tidy table with all the words in the text. Save this object as words.

# 5.5.3 Puerto Rico Hurricane Mortality - Part 1

# In the extdata directory of the dslabs package, you will find a PDF file containing daily mortality data for Puerto Rico from Jan 1, 2015 to May 31, 2018. You can find the file like this:

fn <- system.file("extdata", "RD-Mortality-Report_2015-18-180531.pdf", package="dslabs")

# Find and open the file or open it directly from RStudio. On a Mac, you can type:
  
system2("open", args = fn)

# and on Windows, you can type:
  
system("cmd.exe", input = paste("start", fn))

# Path: file:///C:/Users/y.hernandes/AppData/Local/R/win-library/4.3/dslabs/extdata/RD-Mortality-Report_2015-18-180531.pdf

# Question 1 - Which of the following best describes this file?

#  It is a report combining graphs and tables. Extracting the data seems possible.

# Question 2 - We are going to create a tidy dataset with each row representing one observation. The variables in this dataset will be year, month, day and deaths.
# Use the pdftools package to read in fn using the pdf_text function. Store the results in an object called txt.

txt <- pdf_text("C:/Users/y.hernandes/AppData/Local/R/win-library/4.3/dslabs/extdata/RD-Mortality-Report_2015-18-180531.pdf")

# or txt <- pdf_text(fn)

head(txt)

# Describe what you see in txt.
# text is a vector of character with lenght 12 [1:12] - it means there are 12 pages

# Question 3 - Extract the ninth page of the PDF file from the object txt, then use the str_split function from the stringr package so that you have each line in a different entry. The new line character is \n (note: \n is the line separator - we need this information
# for the str_split(). Call this string vector x.
# Look at x. What best describes what you see?

txt <- txt[9]
txt

x <- str_split(txt, "\n")  # with str_split() we get a table with several lines, because it interpretates the separator \n as a new line
x
  
# What kind of object is x? Answer: x is a list with 41 lines
  
# How many entries does x have? Answer: 41 lines

# Question 4: Define s to be the first entry of the x object.

s <- x[[1]]  # first entry is not the first row!
length(s)

# What kind of object is s? Answer: a list
# How many entries does s have? Answer: 41 (but 1965eric has 40)

# Question 5: When inspecting the string we obtained above, we see a common problem: white space before and after the other characters. 
# Trimming is a common first step in string processing. These extra spaces will eventually make splitting the strings hard so we start by removing them.
# We learned about the command str_trim() that removes spaces at the start or end of the strings. Use this function to trim s and assign the result to s again.

s <- str_trim(s)
s
# After trimming, what single character is the last character of element 1 of s? Answer: "
s[1]

# Question 6: We want to extract the numbers from the strings stored in s. However, there are a lot of non-numeric characters that will get in the way. We can remove these, 
# but before doing this we want to preserve the string with the column header, which includes the month abbreviation.
# Use the str_which function to find the row with the header. Save this result to header_index.
# Hint: find the first string that matches the pattern "2015" using the str_which function.

str_which(s, "2015") # row [3] and [25] but I only want to save the first, so [3]

header_index <- str_which(s, "2015")[1]
class(header_index) # it is an integer: a numeric but not so heavy as a "double" or "numeric"

# What is the value of header_index? Answer: 3
header_index

# Question 7: We want to extract two objects from the header row: month will store the month and header will store the year names. 
# Save the content of the header row into an object called header, then use str_split to help define the two objects we need.
# What is the value of month? Use header_index to extract the row. The separator here is one or more spaces. Also, consider using the simplify argument.

header <- s[header_index]

temp <- str_split(header, "\\s+", simplify = TRUE) # here we can see the position of each object, with simplify = TRUE. Important: save the result in a temporary object, it is not possible to save it in header

month <- temp[1]
month


header <- temp[2:5]
header

# What is the third value in header? Answer: 2017

header[3]

# 5.5.4 Puerto Rico Hurricane Mortality - Part 2
# Notice that towards the end of the page defined by s you see a “Total” row followed by rows with other summary statistics. Create an object called tail_index with the index of the “Total” entry.
# What is the value of tail_index? Answer: 36

tail_index <- str_which(s, "Total")
tail_index

# Question 9: Because our PDF page includes graphs with numbers, some of our rows have just one number (from the y-axis of the plot). 
# Use the str_count function to create an object n with the count of numbers in each row.
# How many rows have a single number in them? You can write a regex for a number like this \\d+.


n <- str_count(s, "\\d+")  # quantifier + means one or more

table(n)  # two rows have a single number in them
sum(n == 1)


n # our table with month + years has only 5 numbers, the other rows have information from graph or text etc. which we do not need.

# Question 10: We are now ready to remove entries from rows that we know we don’t need. The entry header_index and everything before it should be removed. 
# Entries for which n is 1 should also be removed, and the entry tail_index and everything that comes after it should be removed as well.
# How many entries remain in s? Answer: 30

# create an object with the index we do not need

s1 <- c(1:header_index, which(n==1), tail_index:length(s))
s1

# remove the object from s with the index we do not need
s <- s[-s1]
s

# Question 11: Now we are ready to remove all text that is not a digit or space. Do this using regular expressions (regex) and the str_remove_all function. 
# In regex, using the ^ inside the square brackets [] means not, like the ! means not in !=. To define the regex pattern to catch all non-numbers, you can type [^\\d]. 
# But remember you also want to keep spaces.
# Which of these commands produces the correct output?

s <- str_remove_all(s, "[^\\d\\s]")
s


# Question 12: Use the str_split_fixed function to convert s into a data matrix with just the day and death count data:
s <- str_split_fixed(s, "\\s+", n = 6 )[,1:5]  # [,1:5] means it only keep the columns 1 to 5, so the rest will be removed. The meaning of n =6, 6 is the maximum number of pieces to return. Default n = Inf uses all possible (infinite) split positions
s

# Now you are almost ready to finish. Add column names to the matrix: the first column should be day and the next columns should be the header. 
# Convert all values to numeric. Also, add a column with the month. Call the resulting object tab.

tab <- as.data.frame(s) %>%
  mutate_all(as.numeric) %>%
  add_column(month = month, .before = 1) %>%
  setNames(c("month", "day", header))
  

tab  # convert to numeric, before adding the column with the month

# What was the mean number of deaths per day in September 2015?
# What is the mean number of deaths per day in September 2016?

mean(tab$"2015")
mean(tab$"2016")
mean(tab$"2017") # over the mean
mean(tab$"2018")

# Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico on September 20, 2017. What was the mean number of deaths per day from September 1-19, 2017, before the hurricane hit?

mean(tab$"2017"[1:19])

# What was the mean number of deaths per day from September 20-30, 2017, after the hurricane hit?

mean(tab$"2017"[20:30])

# Question 13: Finish it up by changing tab to a tidy format, starting from this code outline:

# What code fills the blank to generate a data frame with columns named “day”, “year” and “deaths”?

tab <- tab %>% 
  pivot_longer(- c("month", "day"), names_to = "year", values_to = "deaths") %>%
  mutate(deaths = as.numeric(deaths))
 
tab

# Question 14: Make a plot of deaths versus day with color to denote year. Exclude 2018 since we have no data. 
# Add a vertical line at day 20, the day that Hurricane Maria hit in 2017.

tab %>%
  filter(year != 2018) %>%
  ggplot(aes(day, deaths, col = year, label = year)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 20, col = "black") +
  geom_point()
