# Download the dslabs packages. This is the example dataset, we are working with

# Where is the dataset from dslabs stored in my system? Which files are stored?

system.file("extdata", package = "dslabs")
path <- system.file("extdata", package = "dslabs")
list.files(path)

### Importing the files to my working directory

# 1. getting the right path name

filename <- "murders.csv"
fullpath <- file.path(path, filename)
fullpath

# 2 . copying the filename in my working directory

file.copy(fullpath, getwd())

# 3. checking if the file is in my working directory

file.exists(filename)

# Before importing the dataset in R, we want to know wich format it has, in order to choose the right code to import it

read_lines ("murders.csv", n_max = 3)    # read only the first 3 lines, to see if there is a header

# Importing the dataset in R with tidyverse

dat <- read_csv(filename)  # importing data with read_csv from tidyverse

head(dat)

# Importing the dataset in R with R-base functions

dat2 <- read.csv(filename)

head(dat2)

# What is the difference when importing with R-Base comparing to importing with tidyverse?

class(dat)  # when importing with the tidyverse we get a table (tibble)
class(dat2) # when importing with R-base we get a data frame

# Question 1: ok, and? table vs data.frame? 
# see https://megapteraphile.wordpress.com/2020/03/25/data-frame-vs-data-table-vs-tibble-in-r/
# 1. data.frame are the original data structure in R-Base
# 2. data.table is faster than data.frame (use less memory)
# 3. tibble has the class tbl_df and is a perfection of the original data.frame. It belongs to the tidyverse, so it works
# with the tidyverse packages: ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr and readr

  setNames(1:12) %>%
  mutate(year = as.character(1959:1997))

# Question 14: Load the admissions dataset from dslabs, which contains college admission information for men and women across six majors, and remove the applicants percentage column:

tmp

# Combine the key and gender and create a new column called column_name to get a variable with the following values:

# Remaining problems, which were not solved with the previous patterns

# 1- Many students measuring exactly 5 or 6 feet did not enter any inches. For example, 6' - our pattern requires that inches be included.
# 2- Some students measuring exactly 5 or 6 feet entered just that number.
# 3- Some of the inches were entered with decimal points. For example 5'7.5''. Our pattern only looks for two digits.
# 4- Some entires have spaces at the end, for example 5 ' 9.
# 5- Some entries are in meters and some of these use European decimals: 1.6, 1,7.
# 6- Two students added cm.
# 7- One student spelled out the numbers: Five foot eight inches.

# Solutions:

# 1- add '0

i <- 3008

campaign_tweets$text[i]

campaign_tweets[i,] %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>%
  select(word)

# Important characters in twitter were omitted by the unnest_tokens() function
# because these are not standard English written characters. So, lets define a 
# pattern with these special tokens for twitter

# The pattern appears complex but all we are defining is a patter that starts 
# with @, # or neither and is followed by any combination of letters or digits:

pattern <- "([^A-Za-z\\d#@']|'(?![A-Za-z\\d#@]))"

# meaning of ?

# We can now use the unnest_tokens() function with the regex option and 
# appropriately extract the hashtags and mentions:

campaign_tweets[i,] %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, text, token = "regex", pattern = pattern) %>%
  select(word)

# Another minor adjustment we want to make is remove the links to pictures:

# there are 68790 words

# And we can now answer questions such as "what are the most commonly used words?"

tweet_words %>% 
  count(word) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

stop_words  #are not informative words, like prepositions. Tidytext has database with these.

# If we filter out rows representing stop words with filter(!word %in% stop_words$word):

tweet_words <- campaign_tweets %>%
